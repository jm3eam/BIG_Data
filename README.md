# BIG_Data
Big Data and Data Wrangling project - choosing data from Miami Dade County Public Service 
Our analysis of the 2023 service records from the 311
Contact Center revealed important insights into service
request trends, distribution across neighborhoods, and
completion time patterns. Using data-driven techniques,
we aim to streamline resource allocation, enhance public
service delivery, and improve the quality of life for
Miami-Dade County residents
